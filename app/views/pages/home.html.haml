          %p Attention to detail cannot be explained in plain words, but it could be only felt. Even though it merely targets subconsciousness, it also gives birth to motivations and strongly impacts actual decisions. Poor or well-cut, minimized or stuffed, template-like or hypercreative, website design might either attract or repel your visitors. Through years of experience, we’ve got our own simple secret of conceptual versatility. We tend not borrow ideas, instead we generate brand new ideas ourselves. Simple ideas. This proves to give the most sophistication. Simplicity sells.
