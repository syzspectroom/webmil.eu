          %p Attention to detail cannot be explained in plain words, but it could be only felt. Even though it merely targets subconsciousness, it also gives birth to motivations and strongly impacts actual decisions. Poor or well-cut, minimized or stuffed, template-like or hypercreative, website design might either attract or repel your visitors. Through years of experience, we’ve got our own simple secret of conceptual versatility. We tend not borrow ideas, instead we generate brand new ideas ourselves. Simple ideas. This proves to give the most sophistication. Simplicity sells.

          %p The process of creating a distinct product resembles building a chain out of separate ideas. Transforming concepts and ideas into solid product was the backbone of our work for many years. Every product needs reliable code. We are proficient in a variety of programming languages and technologies. We like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (jQuery), SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL, PHP5 (and web-frameworks like Symfony, Symfony 2), Apache, nginx.​ Multiple code reviews, immediate reaction on prohecyplan changes in project plus tight cooperation with client ensure maximum perfected outcome.

          %p Alongside with software improvement the very interfaces get way more elaborate too, day by day. Leaflet-likeness of websites is now the matter of the past. Taking a good degree of sophistication for granted, we focus on start-ups and turnkey projects of any type. In other words, we are quite start-up-friendly.

          %p Sound software is undoubtedly our major care. For it to be well-tailored, reliable code is of first priority. Apparently, the main objective of our software-making work is to produce code of the best quality, that not only functions smoothly at the time being, but is flexible enough to be updated and applicable with new purposes.
